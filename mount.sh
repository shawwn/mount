You're not running as root. Run `sudo su` followed by `./setup.sh` and try this
script again.

Explanation:

For reasons I haven't figured out yet, you must run as root (and then stay
root). If anyone would like to help debug this, that would be much appreciated.

Normally you shouldn't do this -- after all, I could be adding a backdoor --
but the sad truth is, I simply can't figure out the problem and don't have
time right now; this is the only solution that seems to work, so I wanted
to leave the choice to you.

Exiting. To try running as non-root anyway, run with FORCE=1
